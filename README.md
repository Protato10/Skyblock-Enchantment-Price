# Skyblock-Enchantment-Price
Allows you to input any buyable enchantment in the game and find it's insta-buy price. This program contains every enchantment you can buy on bazaar that's near a million coins and up. i.ei Rejuvenate 1 books are only a few thousand coins so they are not included, but a Rejuvenate 5 book is around 1 million coins and is included.
I suck at coding so spelling and capitalization matter the only thing you do not need to worry about are "-" and "'"(these are only on like 5 enchantments). WHen imputing a enchantment make sure that it is spelled exactly the same as in-game, has correct capitalization, and use numbers, not roman numerals.
